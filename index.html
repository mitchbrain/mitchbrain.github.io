						<h3>Lockheed Martin Aero</h3>
						<h6>January 2018 - Now</h6>
						<p>Currently working on a team creating infrastructure software for a unreleased distributed computing  solution intended for a fighter jet.</p>
						<p>Our team is developing messaging frameworks for communication between cards and legacy hardware. We are also creating health monitoring, debugging, and maintenance tools. Utilizing the Agile methodology, our C++ code-base is built and tested using a modern CI/CD pipeline comprised of git, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Docker, Sonarcube and Openshift, which is a GUI for Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
						<p>I have experience traveling to engage with customers and external companies directly, and I've helped them integrate hardware in labs and assisted in the implementation of our libraries into existing codebases.</p>
						<p>I also lead the implementation of design and configuration of our Linux operating system. We had to do alot of really low level automation to make this happen (loads of bash and Python scripts querying IPMI, I2C, SNMP). I also stood up the pipelines to generate binary OS images intended to be flashed on to our hardware.<p/>
